# Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting sales using the Kaggle Sales Prediction dataset. Through rigorous data exploration, preprocessing, and model training, the project aims to identify the most effective machine learning method for sales prediction.

## Features
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Thorough analysis and preparation of the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers to ensure high data quality.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training of three different models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Each model's performance was assessed using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- **Results Analysis**: Detailed comparison of model performances with insights into the effectiveness of each predictive model.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
