# Sales Strategy Selection for a New Product Line

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing sales strategies for a new product line using the Kaggle Sales Prediction dataset. Through rigorous data exploration, preprocessing, and model training, the project aims to identify the most effective sales strategies based on predictive analytics.

## Features
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Thorough analysis and preparation of the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers to ensure high data quality.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training of three different models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Each model's performance was assessed using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- **Results Analysis**: Detailed comparison of model performances with insights into the effectiveness of each predictive model in sales strategy context.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
